# Plasticity

There are several ways to unlock trial version of Plasticity app. Mainly about how to bypass (by just flipping 1 bit in memory):
* AES-GCM licence encryption,
* License ECDSA signing
* Onload module hash validation
* Complex app structure with NodeJS jsc code

All this is for educational purpose.

# Method

Just put atached files:
* libcrypto-1_1-x64.dll
* plasticity_patcher.dll

to D:\Plasticity\app-1.4.10\resources\app\.webpack\renderer directory
